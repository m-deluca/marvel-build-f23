                The Commando
            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Commando is a playable character in both Risk of Rain and Risk of Rain 2. He is the first available character and does not need to be unlocked.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">In Risk of Rain 2, he is unlocked by default and is intended as a well-rounded and easily-understood character with no particular strengths or weaknesses. Commando is a simple character to play, and his attacks use his two pistols. He is considered to be a reliable character and scales well with items, but can be weak in the early game. Some players consider him to be the weakest survivor, but this can also be used to his advantage. To play Commando effectively, players should focus on item stacking to help his relatively simple attacks.</p>

                The Huntress
            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Huntress is a playable character in Risk of Rain 2. She is a hunter who specializes in long-range attacks, relying largely on her bow for damage output.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">Huntress is a glass cannon, meaning she can deal massive amounts of damage but can also die immediately if not played carefully. Her base health is incredibly low, but her quick base speed makes up for this. Huntress is unlocked by default and is one of the original characters from the first Risk of Rain game.</p>

                Mercenary
            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Mercenary is a playable character in Risk of Rain 2. He is a high skill melee survivor that uses his many dodges to weave in and out of combat. Mercenary is unlocked by completing the True Respite challenge, which involves obliterating yourself at the Obelisk after completing stage eight and going through the Celestial Portal that appears.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">Mercenary is a melee survivor with high damage but low survivability. He is one of the game's only melee survivors, so players need quick reflexes and the right items to excel at this fast-paced character. Mercenary's abilities include Laser Sword, which is a quick, high-damage sword attack that can be used up to three times in quick succession. His Utility Blinding Assault allows him to dash forward and become invulnerable for a short time, while his Special Whirlwind allows him to spin around with his sword, dealing damage to all nearby enemies. Mercenary is considered to be one of the hardest survivors to play in Risk of Rain 2, but he can be very powerful in the right hands.

                Engineer
            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">The Engineer is a playable character in Risk of Rain 2. He is a defense-oriented character with an assortment of deployable gadgets that make him a versatile and damage-oriented character. The Engineer's strength comes not from him alone, but from his ability to deploy a number of both offensive and defensive tools, allowing him to control the battlefield and change the tide of combat in an instant.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">To unlock the Engineer, players must complete 30 stages in the game. The Engineer's abilities include Bouncing Grenades, which is a grenade that bounces up to three times, dealing 230% damage per hit. His Utility Bubble Shield creates a barrier around the player that blocks enemy attacks for some time, while his Special Pressure Mines and Spider Mines deal different amounts of damage depending on how long they are charged. The Engineer is considered to be one of the strongest characters in Risk of Rain 2 if played correctly. He is a complex character to learn how to play, but mastering his abilities can make him a powerful ally in solo or group runs.</p>

                Mul - T
            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">MUL-T is a playable character in Risk of Rain 2. He is a modified multi-purpose robot that lives up to his designation through his sheer versatility. MUL-T is one of the tankiest characters in the game, but he also packs in a lot of utility. To unlock MUL-T, players must complete the first teleporter event five times.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">MUL-T specializes in switching between different attacks, and his lack of speed puts him at a disadvantage at close range, so players should try to keep their distance when attacking. His abilities include Auto-Nailgun, which rapidly fires nails for 60% damage, and Rebar Puncher, which charges up and fires piercing rebar for 600% damage. His Utility Blast Canister launches a stun canister for 220% damage and drops stun bomblets for 5x44% damage, while his Special Transport Mode allows him to zoom forward, gaining armor and speed and dealing 250% damage to enemies in the way. MUL-T is an effective playable class in Risk of Rain 2, offering ranged attacks with decent damage and the ability to land proximity attacks as well. He is also capable of holding two pieces of equipment at once because of his Retool skull. MUL-T has a total of eight abilities that help the player survive in the game, with Power Mode being the best ability, which gives the player more strength and double the damage per second.</p>

                Loader
            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Loader is a playable character in Risk of Rain 2. She is a slow but powerful survivor that can cause havoc on the battlefield with her Gauntlets and Grappling Hooks. To unlock Loader, players must complete the Guidance Offline challenge, which involves destroying five blue vulture egg nests in the game.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">Loader's abilities include Scrap Barrier, which makes her immune to fall damage and grants a temporary barrier when she strikes enemies with her gauntlets. Her Primary Knuckleboom allows her to swing at nearby enemies for 320% damage, while her Secondary Grapple Fist fires her gauntlet forward, pulling her to the target. Her Utility Charged Gauntlet and Thunder Gauntlet deal different amounts of damage, while her Special M551 Pylon creates a pylon that zaps nearby enemies for 200% damage. Loader is a heavy-hitting melee character in Risk of Rain 2, excellent for clearing crowds or dealing significant damage to a single target. She is considered to be one of the most powerful survivors in the game, but her lack of mobility can be a disadvantage.</p>
