                Jonas Kahnwald
            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Jonas Kahnwald was one of the two main influencers of the Knot, born to Michael and Hannah Kahnwald. As a teenager, he lived a happy life until his father's suicide, which started Jonas' depression. After he and his friends lost Mikkel Nielsen in the Winden Forest, Jonas began searching through his father's past, only to learn that Michael was Mikkel, who had time-travelled to the year 1986. When Jonas attempted to rescue Mikkel from the past, which would prevent his own birth, he was intercepted by Noah and was abandoned by his adult self. He escaped 1986 through a Wormhole to 2052.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">In a post-apocalyptic Winden, Jonas faced Elisabeth Doppler and her cult that ruled over the wasteland. He learned about the Apocalypse and how his love interest and aunt Martha Nielsen was killed on the same day. In their captivity, Jonas was aided by Silja Tiedemann to journey through a God Particle to 1921, where he discovered the time-travelling secret society Sic Mundus, led by Jonas' elderly self known as Adam. Adam convinced Jonas to travel to the day before Michael's suicide but, in the end, Jonas was the catalyst in causing the tragedy, making him accept his significant role to play in the overall course of events. When he was slightly older, a time-travelling Jonas and Claudia Tiedemann arrived in the apocalypse, where Jonas attempted to rescue Martha, who was killed by Adam.</p>

            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Hannah Kahnwald (née Krüger) is the widow of Michael and mother of Jonas. She is a clever woman, driven by pain and vengeance and doesn't shy away from conspiracies. She's been dealt a tough hand: Her husband commits suicide and their son Jonas gets sent to a psychiatric inpatient facility shortly after.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">From a young age, she had an obsession with Ulrich Nielsen and in 2019 has an affair with him. Hannah works as a physiotherapist, counting Aleksander Tiedemann, director of the Winden Nuclear Power Plant, among her clients.</p>

                Ulrich Nielsen
            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Ulrich Nielsen was a headstrong police officer whose brother Mads Nielsen went missing when he was a rebellious teenager. Throughout the times he mourned for Mads, Ulrich was dating Katharina Albers and held a grudge against the chief investigator Egon Tiedemann for his lack of results. He was once arrested for false accusations of raping Katharina, but was released upon his charges being cleared. Eventually, Ulrich married Katharina and had three children named Magnus Nielsen, Martha Nielsen and Mikkel Nielsen. His childhood friend Hannah Kahnwald started an affair with him, and one fateful night, Mikkel went missing. Grief-stricken, Ulrich was hellbent on finding his son, going to great lengths such as intruding the Winden Nuclear Power Plant. Upon finding out about Helge Doppler's strange behavior, Ulrich started investigating him, which led him entering the wormhole in Winden Caves that sent him to 1953. Ulrich was stunned to realize that he had traveled through time, and later found young Helge, who he deducted was the killer of his brother. Attempting to change the past, Ulrich bludgeoned Helge to try and kill him, but he only managed to physically and mentally scar the boy for life. This led to a younger Egon Tiedemann arresting him under suspicions of killing two children whose bodies were dumped in 1953.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">Ulrich was sentenced to life at the Winden Psychiatric Facility, and when he was once visited by a time traveling Hannah, he pleaded for her to help him escape, but since Ulrich cared more about Katharina, Hannah left him behind. Over thirty years later, Ulrich was visited by Egon for questioning about the recent disappearance of Mads, and he finally revealed his identity to his old nemesis. When Egon informed him about Mikkel's presence in 1987, Ulrich became frantic and escaped to find his son. After finally reuniting with Mikkel, the two attempted to use the wormhole in the caves, but Ulrich was apprehended by the Winden Police Department. Three months later, Ulrich was visited by a time traveling Katharina, who tried to break him out, but she was tragically murdered by her mother, much to Ulrich's utter dismay. However, when the Knot was finally destroyed, Ulrich was erased from existence.</p>

                Katharina Nielsen
            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Katharina lives with her abusive mother, Helene Albers. Her father is Hermann Albers, although he is out of the picture as a father figure. Katharina is named after Hannah Kahnwald's new identity after traveling to 1954, where a young Helene met Hannah at an abortion clinic.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">As a teen, Katharina is seen as a headstrong pupil at the Winden high school. She is dating the rebellious young Ulrich Nielsen, provoking jealous rage in Hannah Krüger.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">She and Ulrich once tied Regina Tiedemann to a tree in the forest and left her there as a prank. Later, wrongly suspecting Regina has accused Ulrich of rape, Katharina attacks her in the forest, only driven off when a mysterious stranger, later revealed as Boris Niewald, appears brandishing a gun.</p>

                Magnus Nielsen

            <p class="lb_text">Magnus and Franziska are officially a couple. He's known for a while that she hides money in a small box beneath an abandoned railway. One day, Magnus sees someone else putting money in the box. It's Bernadette the prostitute.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">Magnus comes to the wrong conclusions and is outraged with Franziska. He then learns that she is selling Bernadette prescriptions for hormones to complete her gender reassignment. Peter Doppler used to be one of Bernadette's customers and now she relies on his daughter. Franziska is sorely disappointed by Magnus' lack of trust, but she forgives him.</p>

                Martha Nielsen
            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Martha was born in 2003, the second child of Ulrich and Katharina Nielsen. She was brought up, along with her siblings, in the Nielsen family home, her father's childhood house.</p>
            <p class="lb_text">As a teenager, Martha is a sensitive girl who has a passion for acting and seemingly political activism as well. She once goes on a hunger strike to protest child hunger in Africa. Also within the realm of politics, she seems to be somewhat conspiratorial, as well as antiestablishment, or at least anti-nuclear energy. She believes a nuclear-power mafia keeps things hidden from the public to protect the image of the nuclear power plant, for which she is ridiculed by her brother. To her credit, it eventually comes to light that the power plant has been hiding damaging information from the public for over thirty years.</p>
